# SEO Conventions
- Use good link text so users and search engines can easily understand what the linked pages contain before they visit.
- Use rel="nofollow" on links that users generate like the comments under each blog post. This will prevent search engines from following those links and potentially indexing low-quality content.
- Set the pageTitle variable on each page to something that is unique to the page, clear and concise, and accurately describes the contents of the page.
- Ensure each page has a meta description tag, which is typically a succinct, one- or two-sentence summary of the page. A good meta description is short, unique to one particular page, and includes the most relevant points of the page.
- Add descriptive alt text to the images on the website. Alt text is a short, but descriptive piece of text that explains the relationship between the image and your content. 
- Ensure descriptions end with a period.
- Check blog post content for misspellings and grammar issues.


# SEO Things to NOT Do
- Do not use the keywords meta tag.
- Do not keyword stuff content. This is excessively repeating the same words over and over.
