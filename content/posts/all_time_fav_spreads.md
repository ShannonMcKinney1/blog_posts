I love when I get the time to really put some effort into a page. I get to use my fancy pens and stickers. Usually I'll practice on another page first to make sure I get the design ***just*** right. Here is a collection of my favorite pages I've done. 

I was taking a trip to Scotland and wanted to commemorate the trip with a super cute page! I free-handed the outline of the country in pencil, put in most of the little islands that surround it, then went back over it in pen. On the right, I have the cities we were going to and some ideas for food/entertainment places to try. On the left, I put our trip itinerary. This is one of my favorite places I've done so far. I love the way it turned out.

For this page, I wanted to do something special for the month of February. I also had super cute stickers I wanted an excuse to use. Its a lot busier than my other pages which is why I like it! It stands out when I flip through my journal. I also had something going on every weekend so I wanted to organize and celebrate that on the right page. On the left, I wanted to make a bucket list of things for each season. There are certain activities that I like to do every season so I wanted to list them out!

For this page, I used some different mediums for filling in blank space. I cut out pieces from an Ulta Beauty magazine and used them as clouds for a border. I think I could have found a better way than just scotch tape to put these clouds on the page but it worked well enough! I also made this page into a summer bucket list. I find myself looking forward to the next season and imagining all the things I want to do! So I've made a couple seasonal bucket lists.
