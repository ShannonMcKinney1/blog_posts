Its that time of year again! Time to reflect on the past and make plans for the future! I want to go through my 2025 journaling techniques for reflecting and what I am doing to prepare for the new year. 

## Reflect and Review

First I am going to reflect on the past year and ask myself these questions: 
- What about my routines worked well? What didn't? 
- What happened in the last year? What was exciting? What did you learn from?
- What am I looking forward to in the new year? Do I already have anything planned? 
- What do I want my life to look like next year?

The best way I have found to do this is something called "Stream of Conciousness Journaling". This is a fun and easy exercise where you start with one of these questions and start writing! As you're writing, when more thought come into mind, write those down too! It becomes meditative because the writing slows down your thoughts enough to really reflect on what you're thinking. And then you can look back and see what your thoughts and feelings were the past year because now they're written down! 

I wrote about starting my first adult job, moving into a new apartment and looking forward to all the trips I have planned in the new year!

Now that you have your reflection written down, you probably have a better sense of what's important and what you need to plan for in the new year! So now its time to make some goals. 

## Goals

### Step 1

First, I wanted to make a little chart to organize my many thoughts for goals in the new year. This will help you prioritize what are the most important goals to you and align your focus. We are only human after all! We can't do it all! 

For this, I like to use a mind map. My example is below. You start in the middle with 2025 Goals and then branch out to incorporate every aspect of your life. Here are some examples:

- Health
- Relationships
- Career 
- Personal Growth
- Financial Wellness
- Spirituality
- Home

I used a different color for each area so that I can associate a color with an area of my life. It also will make it easier later to see which goals apply to each area of your life. 

Then, branch out from your chosen areas of your life with goals. For example, get more sleep, complete a course that will help me in my career, read more, reconnect with old friends, make a budget.

### Step 2 

Now that we have some first drafts of goals, its time to refine them. Take each goal bubble you made and rewrite them on the next page. But when rewriting, phrase it in a way where it is focused on something you can control. For example, "Be more financially stable" is your end goal or destination. Instead, reword it to "Save a percentage of every paycheck to create an emergency fund". This is something you can control and will lead you to your destination. And make sure you are using SMART goals! 

- **Specific** (Clarity, what needs to be done, what steps are needed)
- **Measurable** (How to measure progress and stay on track)
- **Achievable** (Realistic)
- **Relevant** (make sure it wil lead to your "destination" or end goal)
- **Time-bound** (set a realistic deadline, "by the end of the year" is always good!)

I also continued my color scheme to make my list easier to look at. 

Here is my list:
