My notes on Pluralsight Madecraft Path


Set AUTHENTIC career goals:

- Think about your feelings when thinking about goals
- Evaluate your fears (What did I learn from that experience)
- Get curious about your fear, why are you afraid? Get an outside perspective on it
- Is it a valid concern? Or is it an internal thing you can work on
- Know you values, put them in action so you feel that authenticity
- Find your strong emotions
- When you were proud, what value was there?
- Values list, put them into buckets, pick 20-30 words of who you are and who you want to be, get 5-6 categories and then pick one all-encompassing word
