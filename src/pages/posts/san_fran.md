I had an idea for a super fun travel journal page and set it up before I even left for my trip! I added a header to the page and decorated it with stickers on the sides of the page, making sure I left lots of room in the middle of each page for my journal entry. I had a sheet of stickers that was a list of themed words that I wanted to try and incorporate into a story about my trip. The goal was to use as many of the sticker words as I could to recount my trip in journal-entry form! Here's how it turned out! I also have the transcript of the journal page so it is easier to read. (I also used it to plan out my page before writing everything down in pen).


San Francisco was full of **ADVENTURES**. When I landed, Lennon picked me up from the airport and we had dinner at a 24-hour cafe under the cover of Califorina's **NIGHT SKIES**. The next morning, we walked to get crepes and then we were **ROUGHING IT** via bike to get to our ferry for Alcatraz Island. We made it with plenty of time to spare, thankfully, and enjoyed the **SCENIC VIEWS** of the city. We should've brought our **HIKING BOOTS** for this trip because it was all up-hill and there was plenty of **EXPLORING** we needed to do. We were **HIKING** with a guide up the hill as he talked about the history of the island and when it became a prison. It was an **EXTREME** prison with solitary rooms with no windows. Lennon tried **ROCK CLIMBING** out of the courtyard to no avail. Outside the prison was a whole different story. Surrounding the prison was an **OASIS** of flowers, succulents and **CACTUS**! The gardens were **BEAUTIFUL** and **WILD** and overtaking the landscape. It was a joy to explore. We even learned about the **WILDLIFE** on the Island! The birds come here because they don't need fresh water and their mammal predators do! So there were a bunch of nesting birds that we weren't allowed to disturb. We stopped in the gift shop and got our **NATIONAL PARKS** passport and Alcatraz stamps. Back on the main land, we went on **SIGHTSEEING**. We got Irish Coffee from Buena Vista Cafe along with clam chowder and lobster mac and cheese. We saw a trolley, sat and had happy hour wine tastings like we were in the **VALLEY** and visited Ghirardelli. We loved the **FREEDOM** to try and see new things! For our ride back to the hotel, we were **BEING BRAVE** and took a Waymo! Its a self-driving Uber that was really cool and also kind of scary! We got back in one piece! The next morning, we got breakfast sandwiches and Ubered to the Golden Gate National Park to see the Japanese Gardens. There was this bush that looked like **MOUNTAINS** and a bridge that looked like **ARCHES**. There were also plenty of **SUNNY PLACES** for flowers from around the world to grow. We were **FREE TO ROAM** and admired the **WONDERS** of the century-old trees from Japan that towered over us. It was a great reminder of **BEING PRESENT** as I said hello to the coy fish. We watched a Polish-American celebration dance in the park and then decided to rent bikes to take us down to the **SANDY** beach. The ride was **RELAXING** as we went **EXPLORING NEW PLACES** throughout the rest of the park. When we made it to the beach, we went **OFF-ROADING** in some sand on the bike path to get to the Pacific Ocean. The sun was **HOT** but the breeze kept us cool. There were succulents on the **SAND DUNES** that made it feel like we were **IN THE DESERT**. We shared a lunch from a nearby gas station and enjoyed the sound of the massive waves. I found a broken sand dollar and many crab claws. For dinner, I tried oysters for the first time on the pier. We could see dolphins and whales come up for air in the distance. The oysters were delicious and so was the squid ink seafood pasta. We boarded another ferry to watch the **SUNSETS**. The ride on this ferry was **MY FAVORITE PLACE** we had went on the **OUR TRIP**. Lennon and I took turns sailing the ship and **FINDING NEW LANDSCAPES** across the bay. We sailed right under the Golden Gate Bridge and **THIS MOMENT** was one where I thought **I WILL REMEMBER THIS**. The **COOL SUMMER NIGHTS** did not deter us from sitting on the front of the ship and enjoying each others' company in our **HAPPY PLACE**. We had a **WONDERFUL TIME** on our much-needed **VACATION** to **GO WEST** coast.

I would recommend this challenge to anybody that is looking for a pretty page to brighten up their journal! It was fun to put together and plan but also looks super unique and this page stands out from the rest! I hope this post inspired you and I always love seeing what other bujo people in the community put together, so please share your pages with me in the comments! 

Happy Journaling!
