Well, I can tell you that it has transformed my life for the better. And the best part? You don’t need to spend hours perfecting every page (despite what you might see online). Let me share my journey and offer some inspiration to help you start your own bullet journal.</p>
<p>I first started journaling back in middle school with the small planners we were given at the beginning of each school year. I loved these planners because they helped me stay organized with all my due dates for homework and projects. I never missed a deadline! I think this is where my love for planning and making lists truly began.</p>
<p>Fast forward to high school, and I became <em><strong>really</strong></em> invested in journaling. There was a time when I wrote daily journal entries about what happened during the day, along with my thoughts and feelings. Now, if you have the time and discipline to keep this up, I truly salute you. I managed to maintain this habit for about a year or two, but eventually, life got busier, and daily journaling fell by the wayside. I also had a page each day for my to-dos, schedule, and other notes I needed to jot down.</p>
<p>By the time I reached college, I had stopped journaling altogether. I kept track of tasks and important dates in my Google calendar. Then, one day, I won a bullet journal in a club event drawing. This was my first introduction to bullet journaling (up until then, I had been using lined paper journals).</p>
<p>This bullet journal completely changed the way I organized my life! With its blank pages, I could create my own layouts instead of being restricted by lines. I loved it. In the beginning, I mainly used it as a planner. I did have a few pages for project planning and goal setting, but for the most part, it was purely functional.</p>
<p>Things changed just last year when I got my current journal. I began exploring bullet journal blogs and discovered the creative side of bullet journaling! I didn’t know there was a whole community dedicated to it. That’s when I got into decorating and theming my pages.</p>
<p>Bullet journaling has given me a creative outlet while also helping me manage my busy life. Writing things down helps me remember important tasks and anything else I don’t want to forget.</p>
<p>The best part about bullet journaling, for me, is that it can be whatever you want it to be. Your pages can be messy lists and notes, as long as they work for you! There’s no need to worry about anyone seeing it except yourself. And if you want something visually appealing, the very next page is a blank canvas. The key is to keep it low-stress—just don’t set your expectations too high or aim for &ldquo;the perfect&rdquo; page.</p>
<p>I hope this post has inspired you and encouraged you to start your own journaling journey!</p>
